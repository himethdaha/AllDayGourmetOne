## About AllDayGourmet

We are a company prioritizing customer satisfaction, a happy you is a happy us. Most people are very busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking or enjoying their food. You don't have to worry about it now because we are in town. Users can use our website to select their favourite menus and with a couple of clicks the food will be at your doorstep. You don't need to worry about the quality of food because we have partnered with every restaurent you can imagine to get you the best food possible.Once you have selected an item we will make the order with the restaurent that has the highest rating for that particular item. Leave us the hard work and you can sit back and enjoy the meal.
